# Local Configuraiton Changes

Download images zip folder
Change BG_FOLDER_PATH (src/constants/bg_images.py) to the location locally of the unzipped bg images

# Pipenv guide: https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/

# Organize ouput files:

Let's put all output files into a folder called temp_output/
Name files based off of their assembler / downloader step name
Steps:

1. Downloader - download the tiles
2. Assembler - assemble-tiles to one image
3. Assembler - crop-image to the bbox
4. Assembler - add-pin to the image
5. TransparencyTransformer - Adds transparency to the tile layer. Adds image as background.
6. Assembler - add-style to the map image (transparency etc.)
7. Assembler - add-text to the image
8. Assembler - add-border to the image

TO DO List:

1. Ctrl shift I thing to automatically fix spacing stuff.
2. Clean up import so that they donâ€™t have \*. Only import functions
3. Exception Handling
4. Logging
5. Result Codes
6. Validating Engine inputs
7. Strong typing / hybrid? Not sure? Research pros and cons. Might not be worth doing.
8. Unit Testing - PyTest
9. Integration Testing
10. Acceptance Testing
11. Delete images we downloaded once we are done with them. Clean up functions for each engine call (assembler, downloader, etc.)
12. Bbox edge cases: lon and lat across prime meridian /equator. How are those handled.
13. Think of better way to separate engine_utils into multiple utils.

14. FIll in ValueValidator Class
